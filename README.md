**Welcome**
This is a delightful piece I learned from Blender Guru, a popular YouTube channel for most blender starters. I took this course a week ago and now I am happy to have finished this piece of art and looking to further more in investing time to learn this tool from head to bottom. Thank you

**Note**
If you liked my settings or anything in the video from LinkedIn the settings can be gotten from the file compressed below in the files.

**Thanks**
