**Welcome**

This is a delightful piece I learned from Blender Guru, a popular YouTube channel for most blender starters. I took this course a week ago and now I am happy to have finished this piece of art and looking to further more in investing time to learn this tool from head to bottom. Thank you

**Note**

If you liked my settings or anything in the video from LinkedIn, the settings can be gotten from the file compressed below in the files.
You won't see the full animation though in the blender file because I render in bits in order to check for errors and faster production.

**Thanks**

Thanks to the makers of this wonderful software, I wouldn't be here without this free software, really thank you the creators of Blender.
